# ImgToPDF

Put all of your images into individual PDF pages.

You'll be able to rotate the images as well before pushing them out.
The rotation does result in a black border, which I'll need to fix.

I plan to add resizing, cropping, and a better UI in the future.
But for now, it works. Which is great.
